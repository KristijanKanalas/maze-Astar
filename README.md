# Maze + A* path finding

Maze generated with DFS and a solution found with A* + heuristic path finding
### Made as a project for the AI course at Subotica Tech - College of Applied Sciences - 2018.

# Usage

Open up index.html in your browser and the program will automatically start with DFS making a maze. After the maze is finished, A* algorithm will try to
find a path between start and end of a maze.

### Note - This will not showcase the full power of A* algorithm cause there is only one path from the start till the finish of the maze, if the maze was created with the different algorithm that makes multiple paths, the showcase would be better.
